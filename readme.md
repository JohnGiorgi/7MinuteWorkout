# 7 Minute Workout

A simple Python script to walk you through the 7 minute workout (based on [this](http://journals.lww.com/acsm-healthfitness/Fulltext/2013/05000/HIGH_INTENSITY_CIRCUIT_TRAINING_USING_BODY_WEIGHT_.5.aspx) paper).

To use, simply call `python 7MWO.py`.

You can modify which movements are part of the ciruit by changing the `workouts` list in `7MWO.py`.

*Works on Mac/Linux, not certain about Windows.*
